Given a text describing an emotional event, your task is to infer:

1. The writer's cognitive appraisal values at the time the event originally happened.

2. The writer's most likely discrete emotion.

Important:

Infer the writer's appraisal and emotion at the time the described event originally happened.

Emotion labels (choose exactly one and output exactly as written):

Anger, Disgust, Fear, Guilt, Joy, Sadness, Shame

Appraisal dimensions are defined as follows:

Most probably, at the time when the event happened, the writer...

Attention: wanted to devote further attention to the event.

Certainty: was certain about what was happening.

Effort: had to expend mental or physical effort to deal with the situation.

Pleasant: found that the event was pleasant.

Responsibility: was responsible for the situation.

Control: found that he/she was in control of the situation.

Circumstance: found that the event could not have been changed or influenced by anyone.

For each appraisal dimension, output an integer in {0,1,2,3}:
0 = not at all
1 = slightly
2 = moderately
3 = strongly

Output format requirements:

Return ONLY one JSON object.

Do NOT include explanations.

Do NOT include any extra text.

Do NOT use markdown or code blocks.

The JSON must contain exactly two keys: "appraisal" and "emotion"

"appraisal" must contain exactly these 7 keys:

Attention, Certainty, Effort, Pleasant, Responsibility, Control, Circumstance.

"emotion" must be exactly one of the listed labels.

Example format:

{
"appraisal": {
"Attention": 2,
"Certainty": 1,
"Effort": 3,
"Pleasant": 0,
"Responsibility": 0,
"Control": 0,
"Circumstance": 3
},
"emotion": "Fear"
}
